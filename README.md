# Database Migrations

## Learning Objectives
- Use database migrations to manage changes to table structures
- Use Flyway to manage database migrations

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your machine
3. Open the project in IntelliJ

## Core Activity

- Following on from the activity we did previously to build a Film Database, start by modifying your Flyway Config to point at the db/migrations directory in this project. 
- Connect things up so that you will be creating the database on ElephantSQL as before.
- In the migrations directory use Flyway to initially create a monolithic table to match the structure shown below.

| ID | Title                 | Director               | Director Country | Star              | Star DOB   | Writer                   | Writer Email          | Year | Genre           | Score |

- Then work through the process of adding scripts to migrate the database structure until you end up with a normalised database similar to the one you had in the previous activity.
- When you have reached that point, then you can add a further script that will add in the data shown to the completed database.
- For an extra challenge you could make use of some of the data that can be found in the datasets [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) to use some real data, but don't spend too long on it (also don't try to add too much data to your database).

## Extension Activity

- Modify the database structure further to bring in additional tables (such as Cast) which will link together a film id with multiple actors.
- Modify the database so that Actors, Directors and Writers are all references to a Person table (that way the same person can have multiple roles in a film.)
